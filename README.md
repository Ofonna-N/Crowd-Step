## About
Crowd Step is a 2.5D runner build in 7 days where the player controls a character across several gates along the way which determine how much extra characters get added to the crowd. The decision the player makes could also determine their fate at some point in the level. The game is played by holding down the screen to add steps of characters to enable the player get to more rewarding gates that are typically to high for the player to reach. This mechanic can also be used to avoid obstacles along the way. At the end of the game is the classic carrot and the stick element which raises the players curiosity on what's at the top of the highest stair case.
